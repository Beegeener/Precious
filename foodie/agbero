Hi peeps, i ventured into tech because i would like to increase my income that's neccessary. And  i would also like to improve my level of understanding of the world, improve my logic and reasoning skills, grow my creativity and also work abroad. My sister wants me to study computer science but i love acting so i just take this as an additional learning. Yh, i'm done. BYE.........
